## Focus Verse
> He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned. **~ Mark 16:16**

## The Study
I'm going to start with that scripture. It's not referenced very often, but it's Gospel. It also could be the most concise view on Jesus' plan of salvation for the world.

This was after He had risen. It was his commission to the Apostles. He was, quite simply, telling them what to do.

So, before we go any further, you can probably infer that my position on the plan of salvation involves baptism. This may, or may not, be surprising to you. It also may, or may not, be contrary to what you currently believe. So, let's dig a little deeper.

I want to start by defining the word **baptized** here:

> **baptized** (βαπτίζω baptizō)[G907][G907]: to dip repeatedly, to immerse, to submerge (of vessels sunk); or to cleanse by dipping or submerging, to wash, to make clean with water, to wash one's self, bathe; or to overwhelm.

Sticking with the Bible, baptism must be full immersion. But, before we move on there are some other accounts that we should look at.

> Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing[G907][G907] them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. **~ Matthew 28:19**

Okay, so let's break this scripture down. Let's talk about that **name** of the *Father*, **and of** the *Son*, **and of** the *Holy Ghost*. Let's start with the name of the *Father*:

> I am come in my Father's name, and ye receive me not: if another shall come in his own name, him ye will receive. **~ John 5:43**

We aren't going to deal with the rest of that scripture in this post, that's a message for another time! But, with that scripture, I think we can all agree that the **name** of the *Father* is Jesus.

Now the **name** of the *Holy Ghost*:

> But the Comforter, which is the *Holy Ghost*, whom the *Father* will send in **my name**, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you. **~ John 14:26**

Okay, so now we've got Scripture to provide the **name** of the *Holy Ghost*, Jesus.

With those two Scriptures, and the knowledge that the Son's name is Jesus, we now know the name we are supposed to baptize in: JESUS!

Now let's see some examples of this in action. For that we go to the book of Acts:

> Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be **baptized**[G907][G907] every one of you in the **name of Jesus Christ** for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the *Holy Ghost*. **~ Acts 2:38**

> But when they believed Philip preaching the things concerning the kingdom of God, and the **name of Jesus Christ**, they were **baptized**[G907][G907], both men and women. Now when the apostles which were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent unto them Peter and John: Who, when they were come down, prayed for them, that they might receive the Holy Ghost: (For as yet he was fallen upon none of them: only they were **baptized[G907][G907] in the name of the Lord Jesus**.) **~ Acts 8:12, 14-16**

> Can any man forbid water, that these should not be **baptized**[G907][G907], which have received the *Holy Ghost* as well as we? And he commanded them to be **baptized**[G907][G907] in the **name of the Lord**. Then prayed they him to tarry certain days. **~ Acts 10:47-48**

> And it came to pass, that, while Apollos was at Corinth, Paul having passed through the upper coasts came to Ephesus: and finding certain disciples, He said unto them, Have ye received the *Holy Ghost* since ye believed? And they said unto him, We have not so much as heard whether there be any *Holy Ghost*. And he said unto them, Unto what then were ye **baptized**[G907][G907]? And they said, Unto John's baptism. Then said Paul, John verily baptized with the baptism of *repentance*, saying unto the people, that they should believe on him which should come after him, that is, on Christ Jesus. When they heard this, they were **baptized**[G907][G907] in the **name of the Lord Jesus**. And when Paul had laid his hands upon them, the *Holy Ghost* came on them; and they spake with tongues, and prophesied. **~ Acts 19:1-6**

In these four accounts in Acts there are two things that are consistent. The people are **baptized** using full immersion and they all received the gift of the *Holy Ghost*. See, the water baptism is our way of identifying with His death:

> Know ye not, that so many of us as were baptized[G907][G907] into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death? **~ Romans 6:3**

On the other hand, the reception of the *Holy Ghost*, is the **baptism** of the Spirit:

> I indeed baptize[G907][G907] you with water unto repentance: but he that cometh after me is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to bear: he shall baptize[G907][G907] you with the *Holy Ghost*, and with fire: **~Matthew 3:11**

## Conclusion
The path to salvation is simple, and the formula can be seen clearly in Acts 2:38; **repent, be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ, and receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.**

If you haven't done this yet, find yourself an Apostolic or Pentecostal church (because I know they follow this) and get it done. It's your path to salvation and freedom today!
